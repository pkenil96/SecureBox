# secureBox

Hi there! Welcome to secureBox.

This is my attempt to learn system design at a high level and also get some real time coding skills by writing API(s). 
This is a very simple application, which serves two functions: backup important data from local system and keep the local system up-to-date with the latest updates.

We often deal with multiple devices in office, at school or at home. But we do have our dedicated device that we like to keep up-to-date and which in some ways is our primary machine. In doing so, it becomes tedious to manually move files from cloud to local and vice versa. To solve that problem, i decided to create a simple application that automates the above task.
